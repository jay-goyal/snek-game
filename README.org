#+TITLE: Snake Game
#+AUTHOR: Jay Goyal

A basic snake game written in Rust.

** Code Warning
   This code should not be considered ideal as this is my first attempt at a lot of libraries and Rust in general.

* Running the game
  You need rust to run this game. Install the rust toolchain using rutstup and run the command

  #+begin_src shell
cargo run --release [YOUR-PLAYER-NAME]
  #+end_src

  Giving a player name is mandatory as of now. It will be fixed given time.

TODO:Make the users.json in a fixed directory instead of in the current working directory
TODO:Make the player name optional instead of mandatory
